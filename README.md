# Vote: a program to record the number of times a button was clicked to vote and return it. 

This program displays a question and records the amount of times each option is clicked on.

### Difficulties or opportunities you encountered along the way.

The toughest part was...figuring out how to have the click counted in the bounds of each button.  

### Most interesting piece of your code and explanation for what it does.
In my opinion, the most interesting part of our code is our vote count because it changes with each click and was difficult to make work correctly.
